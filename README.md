## Risk Assessment


## Future Improvements
### More Testing

I would like do more tests but I am at an stage where I no longer know what to aim for. I hope that in the future when I do gain more experience, I could return to this project and commit more tests for better coverage/results.

### Block before 1990 and after 1999

I had hope to implament an rule which prevents certain dates to be input into the database, as this app is based around the 90s. It would make no sense for any entries before or after this certain period.

### Better UI

Very basic look with basic app features. I wanted to add the abilities to include images of both games and consoles. Also, to improve the design on the website to look more up to date/modern compared to what websites we have today.

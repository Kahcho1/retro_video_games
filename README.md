## Project info
### Brief
This project will summariezed all the skills and knowledge I have gained throughout my time during the 9 weeks at QA Limited DevOps Skill Bootcamp. For this project I aim to create a web application that shows the fucntiality of CRUD: Create, Read, Update and Delete. Then I am to host the app within a container using Docker and deploy it. This will display my competence at creating a CI/CD pipeline that is automated for test, build and deploying the app.

### App specification
My project will be based on a database which allows user to input data for video games that were released during the 90s. It will also show what kind of platform that these games were playable on. Furthermore, if users wanted to attached an comment/summary to the entry, they were allowed to.

## Risk Assessment


## Future Improvements
### More Testing


I would like do more tests but I am at an stage where I no longer know what to aim for. I hope that in the future when I do gain more experience, I could return to this project and commit more tests for better coverage/results.

### Block before 1990 and after 1999

I had hope to implament an rule which prevents certain dates to be entered into the database, as this app is based around the 90s. It would make no sense for any entries before or after this certain period.

### Better UI

Very basic look with basic app features. I wanted to add the abilities to include images of both games and consoles. Also, to improve the design on the website to look more up to date/modern silimar to what websites we have today.
